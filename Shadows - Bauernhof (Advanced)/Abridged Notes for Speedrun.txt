Speedrun Abridged Notes - Refer to other documents for more obvious or specific information.

Recommended Team Composition
- Refer to eagle-eye image to best position your team within the map
 - 2x Engineer
	- Can pull the B.M.M.H. and the Ray Gun
		- B.M.M.H. has very good close range damage, the Ray Gun is op at any range
	- Sentry gun can be used for additional damage/early warning system
	- Dispenser range can be upgraded 10x in this mission and will sustain any weapon
 - 2x Pyro
	- Can pull the Thunder Gun and the Ray Gun
		- The Zeus Cannon upgrade can kill giants before their taunt ends
	- Can pull the Minigun
		- Best money generator in the game
		- Even if not using it or the uberweapon version for cash, it's still handly to
		  have one at hand for insta-kill benefit if not using the Ray Gun.
	- Normal shotgun (not-decorated/strange/etc.) can be upgraded to the Burning Love
		- Worse damage than the Thunder Gun, superior range
 - 2x Heavy
	- Can pull the Thunder Gun and the Ray Gun
	- Can pull the Minigun
	- Acces to the Family Business
		- Larger clip is superior early waves than the Shotgun
	- Access to the KGB for crits
		- Mostly beneficial early waves

- Ideally, you want 4 Ray Guns & 2 Thunder Guns as soon as possible for an optimised run.
	- During waves containing tanks, ensure any Thunder Gun/Burning Love users are evenly
	  distributed across the map's tank spawns, and other players should aim to bait tanks
	  towards those players, obviously shooting whilst doing so.
	- Don't run in front of Ray Gun users.
	- Thunder Gun users should prioritise Meraslixir to close the gap to zombies faster.
- When fighting the two bosses in Stage 20, the Thunder Gun is typically a poor engagement choice,
  unless:
	- The boss is hard-focused on another player; do not touch the boss or it will turn around.
		- You can of course attempt to circle-strafe around the boss to avoid damage.
	- You have Ostarion's Reserve; the uber on first death will provide a fairly significant amount
	  of time to deal damage before dying.
	- Giant Treadonator is mid-enrage; it cannot attack for this short period, allowing you to sneak
	  in a hit or two.
		- Note that there is a range at which you can engage this boss without being hit by the chainsaw,
		  but the rockets it occasionally fires will be pracitcally unavoidable at this range.

Power-ups
- Spawn at the bomb hatch after 60-85s, and have a 3% chance of dropping from zombies on death.
  - As such, the team near the hatch should check on it frequently after 1 minute in each wave.
  - Multiple hatch power-ups can spawn each wave, so pick up even useless ones to allow useful
    ones to spawn.
  - Zombie power-ups despawn after 30s if left untouched.
- Fire Sale, Double Points and Bonus Points are useful early game, whilst Nuke and Instakill
  are best late game.
	- Instakill works on ANYTHING, including tanks and bosses, so preserve it for maximum effect.
- Hatch power-ups despawn at stage end, so there is no point in preserving them to the next stage.

Miscellanous Tips
- All zombie hp is revealed when using 'tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 0'.
- Pyrovision Goggles help with identifying zombie position by sound, as low passive noises
  become more clear.
		
Vending Machine Costs Reference, in rough order of importance.
     Double Tap 			$2000
	 Saxton's Ale 			$2000
     Meraslixir				$3000
     Ostarion's Reserve		$1500
     Head Rattle 			$1500

To check:
 Sentry Busters detonate if they cannot reach a player; do Tomb Detonators follow the same logic?
 Medic can convert Tomb Detonators? Doesn't seem to be a sufficient time save to consider.
	They still damage you too lol

Stages
 - Recall that there are a maximum of 26 active zombies of any combination at once.
 - Zombies spawn progressively faster each stage.
 - Generally, there's an 18s intermission between each stage.
 - Refer to Mission Notes file for additional wave details like precise HP values.
