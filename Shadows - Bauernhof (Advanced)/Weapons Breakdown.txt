Bauernhof Weapons Breakdown
 - Analysis of all Bauernhof Weapons Dumpster outcomes, including pull probabilities for each weapon and comments
   on their efficacy, and some notes on starter picks.
 - Includes an appendix on Uberweapons, although most of the ones I've tried were pure shit.
 - As a rule of thumb, most starter weapons have a sizeable damage buff, and can headshot if they are bullet-based.

 - General Upgrade Path
	- Unless you intend to stick with your starter weapon, step 1 is to save up some cash and start pulling from the
	  Weapon Dumpster. Fairly no-brainer.
	- After that, DPS upgrades are the next best thing, assuming you have a consistent ammo suply. Fire rate, followed
	  by Double Tap and then +100% Damage Bonus (where relevant).
	- Secure some survivability - Saxton's Ale.
	- Sort of a catch all for everything else here, the situation impacts what is the best selection too harshly to rank
	  precisely.

 - All classes can roll a dud outcome, causing the box to disappear for 20s before reappearing randomly at possible location.
 - Scout
	- Dud Chance: (1/14)
	- Primary
		- The Shortstop (1/7)
		- The Force-a-Nature (1/7)
		- The Scattergun (1/7)
		- The Punch Packer (1/7)
	  - Selection Comments
		- The Shortstop is easily the worst in the category, whilst all the others have notable differences;
		  the Punch Packer has highest burst DPS, whilst the FaN has highest single-shot dps, with the Scattergun
		  striking a balance between the two.
	- Secondary
		- The SMG (1/7)
		- The Stickybomb Launcher (1/7)
		- The Ray Gun (1/14)
	  - Selection Comments
		- Scout should virtually always start with the pistol as it has the highest clip size.
		  The SMG is worse than any of Scout's starting options, nor does it have an uberweapon upgrade.
		  Not much needs to be said about the Ray Gun other than 11x damage, but the Uberweapon Stickybomb Launcher
		  can potentially outclass it in certain scenarios:
		  Ray Gun						Cactus Blast
		  ========================================================
		  + Effective at all ranges		+ Higher burst DPS (tanks)
		  + Instant Damage (hitscan)	+ Can sticky jump (0.5x default push force)
		  + Many hits ($10 gained per)	+ Better local crowd control
		  - Rare ($950 per pull)		- Poor cash generation (better using another weapon first and saving)
	- Melee
		- The best utility melees for scout are the Candy Cane, the Atomizer and the Fan-o-War.
			The Candy Cane increases explosive damage, so it doesn't combo so well with the Ray Gun or Stickybomb Launcher
		  without having Saxton's Ale.
			The Atomizer is the least useful of the three, but the extra mobility can save you on occasion.
			The Fan-o-War is useless on waves without tanks, and even in Wave 20 they often die before you can close the
		  distance, and often you'll die trying to mark a target. Only in Wave 16 (boss wave) did I managed to find much
		  utility, and even then it's risky business.

 - Soldier
	- Dud Chance: (1/13)
	- Primary
		- The Rocket Launcher  (2/13)
	- Secondary
		- The Beam Rifle (1/13)
		- The Cleaner's Carbine (2/13)
		- The Double Barrel (2/13)
		- The Ray Gun (1/13)
		- The SMG  (2/13)
		- The Tactigatling (1/13)
		- Thunder Gun (1/13)
	  - Selection Comments
		- The reduced arsenal size of Soldier has been carefully balanced by making most options shit.
		  Stick to the default Shotgun unless you prefer the Double Barrel.
		  Stick with your Ray Gun once you pull it, the only other compelling option is the Rocket Launcher.
	- Melee
		- Equalizer is your best unbanned option.

 - Pyro
	- Dud Chance: (1/14)
	- Primary
		- The Dragon's Fury (1/7)
		- The Flamethrower (1/7)
		- The Minigun (1/7)
	- Secondary
		- The Double Barrel (1/7)
		- The SMG (1/7)
		- The Ray Gun (1/14)
		- The Tactigatling (1/14)
		- Thunder Gun (1/14)
	  - Selection Comments
		- Thanks to the presence of accuracy mechanics in this mission, the Minigun should make the best primary
		  for Pyro, though even with its Uberweapon upgrade I still find it to be inferior to the Ray Gun for
		  damage. It is, however, the perfect tool to fund the pulls for a Ray Gun - it easily generates the most
		  cash out of any weapon.
	- Melee
		- The Hot Hand is your only unbanned utility option.
		- Axtinguisher, Back Scratcher and Sharpened Volcano Fragment are your damage options. Largely useless
		  except for the +HP from packs from the Back Scratcher.

 - Demoman
	- Dud Chance: (1/12)
	- Secondary
		- The Beam Rifle (1/12)
		- The Double Barrel (1/6)
		- The Ray Gun (1/12)
		- The Shotgun (1/6)
		- The SMG (1/6)
		- The Stickybomb Launcher (1/6)
		- The Tactigatling (1/6)
	  - Selection Comments
		- The Grenade Launcher is easily the best starter weapon, but being high-damage explossive weaponry is has
		  very poor cash turnover, so getting your hands on a high fire rate weapon early is necessary; this will
		  then allow you to begin to upgrade either your Pipe Launcher or Cactus Blast for maximum damage. Of course,
		  should you pull a Ray Gun, this will all go out the window as it can both generate money for itself and deals
		  sufficient damage to go through all waves.
	- Melee
		- Only usable options are Stock and the Caber.

 - Heavy
	- Dud Chance: (1/13)
	- Primary
		- The Flamethrower (2/13)
		- The Minigun (2/13)
	- Secondary
		- The Beam Rifle (1/13)
		- The Double Barrel (2/13)
		- The Ray Gun (1/13)
		- The SMG (2/13)
		- The Tactigatling (1/13)
		- Thunder Gun (1/13)
	  - Selection Comments
		- The Minigun's uberweapon is your best primary, and your best secondary is of course the Ray Gun; these have
		  already been commented on above, and so has been sticking with your Shotgun or Double Barrel until you pull one.
	- Melee
		- The Killing Gloves of Boxing and Warrior's Spirit are your best unbanned options.

 - Engineer
	- Dud Chance: (1/11)
	- Primary
		- The B.M.M.H (1/11)
		- The Nostromo Napalmer (2/11)
		- The Punch Packer (1/11)
		- The Scattergun (1/11)
		- The Shotgun (1/11)
	- Secondary
		- The Ray Gun (1/11)
		- The SMG (2/11)
	  - Selection Comments
		- The Ray Gun is of course your best secondary, but you have some pretty goood selection of primaries until you get it.
		  Strictly speaking, the Scattergun is better than the Shotgun, some may prefer the Punch Packer over the Shotgun. In
		  either case, the B.M.M.H is easily the best shotgun at your disposal despite its abysmal dropoff (does 8x base damage, 
		  no headshots, higher dmg than Ray Gun at close range, contender for top tank DPS); the Flamethrower option just seems 
		  worse than a shotgun on grounds of effective range.
	- Melee
		- The Eureka Effect, Gunslinger and Jag all have their own utility here; of note, the Gunslinger only provides +25hp
		  in exchange for lower sentry DPS.

 - Medic
	- Dud Chance: (1/13)
	- Primary
		- The Black Box (1/13)
		- The Crusader's Crossbow (2/13)
		- Das Maschinenpistole (1/13)
		- The Flamethrower (2/13)
		- The Punch Packer (2/13)
		- The Scattergun (2/13)
		- The SMG (2/13)
	  - Selection Comments
		- The Blutsauger is probably your best starter given that you can't start with the Crossbow.
		- The Crusader's Crossbow has 4x base dmg.
		- Das Maschinenpistole is an SMG with 5x base dmg of the Syringe Gun per shot.
		- Black Box is probably? best outcome, again, be aware that it's an explosive weapon so generating
		  cash with it will suck, so run something else initially. Note that you fire the entire clip at once, and cannot
		  rocket jump with it.
		- Factor in that you cannot get ammo from dispenser as Medic in you upgrade and weapon selection; note that you can
		  get ammo from an engineer blowing up one of their buildings, however.
	- Melee
		- It's the Ubersaw. What else? Note: the Ubersaw only returns 20% uber on hit.

 - Sniper
	- Dud Chance: (1/15)
	- Primary
		- The Crusader's Crossbow (2/15)
		- The Scattergun (2/15)
		- The Stickybomb Launcher (2/15)
	- Secondary
		- The Beam Rifle (1/15)
		- The Cleaner's Carbine (1/15)
		- The Double Barrel (2/15)
		- The Punch Packer (1/15)
		- The Ray Gun (1/15)
		- The Shotgun (2/15)
	  - Selection Comments
		- This class largely sucks. You have the worst pull outcomes of any class, but you are in a unique
		  position with the Carbine providing on-demand mini-crits, which you can combo with the Cactus Blast
		  for hilarious burst DPS. Probably insufficient for me to take it seriously, however. It's also seriously
		  buggy on this class - sometimes you just lose access to it for the whole game, with no workaround.
	- Melee
		- Bushwacka is probably still best with the Carbine. Without it, you have a selection of anything from
		  the Shahanshah (best panic option), Stock (most reliable), or the Tribalman's Shiv (best DPS).

 - Uberweapons (unsure if all these stats are correct, some pertinent info may be missing)
   - Note that most Uberweapons cannot be upgraded; the listed stats are compared to their UNUPGRADED base weapons, and so
	 may actually be worse than a fully upgraded base.
   - Uberweapons are almost always worse than just rerolling for a new weapon.
	- The Thunder Gun
		- The only uberweapon you do not need to meet any prerequisites for; you can simply pull it from the dumpster.
			- If you already have the Thunder Gun, you will instead pull a Double Barrel with continued pulls.
		- Did something around 3200~ dmg unupgraded per shot whilst testing.
		- Has a range limited to slightly greater than melee, indicated by the particle effect when firing.
			- Quite dangerous to use but could have tank potential
