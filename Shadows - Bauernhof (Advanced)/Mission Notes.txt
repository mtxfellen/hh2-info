Mission Notes
 - This is an endurance mission, segmented into 20 rounds.
   - You can only respawn on round end; if all players die before round end, the mission is failed.
   - There are no re-animators in this mission, and players cannot buy-back.
   - Players cannot join mid-wave, but they can join if they select a class between rounds.
 - Players start with $500 cash.
   - Additional money is gained when hitting ($10) and killing enemies ($50, $100 for headshot kill).
 - There are a maximum of 26 zombies spawned at any given time.
   - Zombies gain hp and speed each round.
   - Most zombies emit sounds passively, revealing their location.
   - All zombie hp is revealed when using 'tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 0'.
 - Weapons can be bought from a dumpster that spawns after Stage 1 begins.
   - Only one player can use the weapons dumpster at once.
   - Weapons replaced by those from the dumpster are lost; you can only equip them again by finding them
     in the dumpster.
	 - You do not have to equip weapons that the dumpster offers, but it will free up access faster to it
	   if you do so.
   - Weapon upgrades can be refunded from the upgrades station at any time.
 - Vending machines provide various perks until death (they don't stack with themselves).

     Double Tap 			$2000		1.5x fire rate
     Meraslixir				$3000		2x reload speed, move at 107% speed (stock medic/spy)

Class Notes
	 - All classes move at 93% speed (stock Demoman).
	 - All classes have 100hp base.
	 - All classes can headshot by default; most projectiles, explosive weaponry and melee weapons cannot.
	 - Players start with their secondary weapon and melee weapon, unless their choice is banned, in which
	   case they start with the stock weapon for that slot.
	Scout
	 - Cannot double-jump.
	Demoman
	 - Starts with his primary instead of his secondary.

Power-ups
 - At the bomb hatch, power-ups spawn after 60-85s, which are activated by one team member running
   over the hatch. 
 - Zombies have a 3% chance of dropping a power-up on death, which despawn after 30s(?).
 - Where applicable, the team member that activates the hatch power-up is the one that benefits
   from its effects.
 - Power-ups from zombies apply to the whole team where applicable.
 - Hatch power-ups despawn at round end, so there is no point in preserving them.
 - Power-ups last ~30s from activation.
 - Power-up effects
    - Nuke (kills all alive zombies)
    - Resupply
    - Free Money (to a value of $2000)
