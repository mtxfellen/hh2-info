Mission Notes
 - This is an endurance mission, segmented into 20 rounds.
   - You can only respawn on round end; if all players die before round end, the mission is failed.
   - There are no re-animators in this mission, and players cannot buy-back.
   - Players cannot join mid-wave.
 - Players start with $500 cash.
   - Additional money is gained when hitting and killing enemies.
 - There are a maximum of 26 zombies spawned at any given time.
   - Zombies gain hp and speed each round.
   - Most zombies emit sounds passively, revealing their location.
   - All zombie hp is revealed (like giants), so use 'tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 0'.
 - Weapons can be bought from a dumpster that spawns from Wave 2 onward.
   - Weapons replaced by those from the dumpster are not lost - they can be equipped again
     from the Upgrades Station under Extra Loadout Items, and the upgrades bought for those
	 weapons remain intact.
   - Weapon upgrades can be refunded from the upgrades station at any time.
 - Vending machines provide various perks until death (they don't stack with themselves).
     Saxton's Ale 			$2000		+150 max hp
     Double Tap 			$2000		1.5x fire rate
     Meraslixir				$3000		2x reload speed, move at 107% speed (stock medic/spy)
     Ostarion's Reserve 	$1500		Protected from one fatal hit
     Head Rattle 			$1500		Explosive Headshots Upgrade
 - All classes are limited to 2, spy is banned.
 - Accuracy is doubled whilst crouching.
 - Accuracy is reduced 1/3 whilst moving (how is crouch-jumping handled?).
 - Players and zombies deal no random crits.
 - Overheal amount is halved
 - All classes move at 93% speed (stock Demoman).
 - All classes have 100hp base.
 - All classes can headshot by default; most projectiles, explosive weaponry and melee weapons cannot.
 - Players start with their secondary weapon and melee weapon, unless their choice is banned, in which
   case they start with the stock weapon for that slot.
    - Medic has no such initial slot restriction.
    - Demoman instead starts with his primary, and his secondary is restricted.
    - If you pick the B.A.S.E. jumper, it's bugged and you get nothing to replace it.
